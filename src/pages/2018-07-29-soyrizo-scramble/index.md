I absolutely *love* the soyrizo from Trader Joe's. If you haven't tried it yet, you should!

## You'll Need:

- 2 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil
- 50g Trader Joe's Soyrizo
- 15g feta cheese

## Directions:

1. Heat 1 tablespoon of coconut oil in a medium pan
2. crack 2 eggs into the pan and break up the yolks and whites as you stir them in
3. Add soyrizo onto the eggs and stir continuously
4. Add feta when the eggs and soyrizo are almost finished cooking
5. Serve with roasted veggies ðŸ˜Š (not included in nutrition information)

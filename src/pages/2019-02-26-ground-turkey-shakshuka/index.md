You'll be shook for this shakshuka. This meal is *so* good! Ahh! I absolutely love shakshuka, and when you make this variation with ground turkey it really takes it to the next level and turns it from a breakfast dish to an all-day dish. I've had this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and love it more and more each time.

You can make this two ways. On the left is with mashed tomatos and on the right is with whole peeled tomatoes:

This recipe will be with peeled tomatoes, but swap the can out for the other type:

## You'll Need:

- 1 can of [whole peeled tomatoes](https://amzn.to/2XD6YxU)
- 1 large yellow onion, diced (leave out for keto/fewer carbs)
- 5 cloves of garlic, diced
- 1/2 cup of kale
- 1/2 cup of spinach
- 2/3lb of ground turkey
- 6 large brown eggs
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil
- 2 teaspoon of basil
- 2 teaspoon za’atar
- 2 teaspoon cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, to taste
- 1 teaspoon salt, to taste
- 1 teaspoon tumeric
- 1 teaspoon lemon pepper

## Directions:

1. Preheat sauté pan with coconut oil
2. Add diced onions and garlic to skillet medium heat, sauté for 5 minutes or until onions and garlic begin to brown
3. Add in kale and spinach, sauté for 1-2 minutes
4. Add ground turkey and stir in
5. Pour full can of tomatoes and juice into sauté pan, sauté for 3-4 minutes
6. After greens have shrunk, create “wells” in the tomato base. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, dip spoon to the bottom of the pan and move contents over by 3-4 inches. A space should be created, and before the tomato base moves back into the space, crack egg into the well and make sure it is touching the bottom of the pan as much as possible. Repeat this step with the remainder of the eggs. It is recommended that 5 eggs should line the outer ring the pan and the final 6th egg should be in a middle well.
7. Add spices. Cook for 5-8 minutes. In final 2-3 minutes, bring grill to high heat or as needed to firm up / crisp the bottom and edges of the base, and if you would like the eggs to be firmer or more runny.
